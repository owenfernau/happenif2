### HappenIf
HappenIf is a suggestion box in a web app. There will be private and public boxes. Invite only and view only ones. The suggestions will be ranked by the group's participants. The voting mechanism (frequency, whether the suggestions will always be up for grabs, number of votes per session) is yet to be determined and will require careful thought.
