### HappenIf
HappenIf is a suggestion box in a web app. There will be private and public boxes. Invite only and view only ones. The suggestions will be ranked by the group's participants. The voting mechanism (frequency, whether the suggestions will always be up for grabs, number of votes per session) is yet to be determined and will require careful thought.

“Never play to the gallery […] if you feel safe in the area that you’re working in, you’re not working in the right area. Always go a little further into the water than you feel you’re capable of being in. Go a little bit out of your depth and when you don’t feel that your feet are quite touching the bottom, you’re just about in the right place to do something exciting.” <br />

– David Bowie
